# MOVIES MOVIES MOVIES

Live site [here](https://moviesmoviesmovies.netlify.app/)

I found a free movie api and wanted to create a quick site. Since the api endpoints were different genres, I created a dropdown menu with those values. On selection, the movies from that genre display to the page. I also added a search feature to search the movies by title.

## Built With
React
Next
CSS

## Optimizations
The movie data in this api was limited to title, image, and imdbId. I could add a link to the imdb page for more information.

## Lessons Learned
I learned how do use a menu of dropdown items to pass in the selected value as the endpoint to my api fetch request. I also created a gradient title and a scroll to top button. It took some troubleshooting with the search bar to get everything working properly such as only the searched movies displaying and resetting the input.
